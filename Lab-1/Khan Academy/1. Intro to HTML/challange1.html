        <h1> The Sail (by Mikhail Lermontov) </h1>
            <p>
                A lonely sail is flashing white <br>
                Amdist the blue mist of the sea!… <br>
                What does it seek in foreign lands? <br>
                What did it leave behind at home?.. <br> <br>
                
                Waves heave, wind whistles, <br>
                The mast, it bends and creaks… <br>
                Alas, it seeks not happiness <br>
                Nor happiness does it escape! <br> <br>
                
                Below, a current azure bright, <br>
                Above, a golden ray of sun… <br>
                Rebellious, it seeks out a storm <br>
                As if in storms it could find peace!
            </p>
